    <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
    <p>
      We keep basic historical information on your use of this website via
      <a href="//piwik.org/">Piwik</a> analytics. This is self-hosted and
      open-sourced, so none of your information will leave our server or be
      sold to any third parties.

      Ever.

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>Why do we collect data?</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing how many users a service has and how often it gets used
      tells us how popular that service is.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a service is getting a lot of use, we will try to provide more
      support and focus our attention on that service.

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>Can I opt out?</h2>
    <p>
      Of course! You can <a href="{% url 'privacy_opt_out' %}">opt out</a>
      (or in) at any time if our privacy policy becomes unacceptable.
